# Travel-Insurance-Claim-Prediction
Insurance companies take risks over customers. Risk managing is a very crucial aspect
of the insurance industry. Insurers evaluate every quantifiable factor to generate profiles
of high and low insurance risks. Insurers gather vast amounts of information about
policyholders and analyze the data. As Data scientists in an insurance company, we
need to examine the available data and predict whether the client would claim the travel
insurance or not.

In this project, we are going to implement various types of machine learning classification
algorithms to forecast whether the client would claim the travel insurance and which
sectors to focus to mitigate risk. In this case, we study about the previous customers of
a travel insurance company to predict the outcome.
